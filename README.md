# "John Doe" - Blog Project
Main designer - Julian Salamanca
Created by me, Jose Rios @joseriosdev

This small project was created so we both can practice our just learned skills. He as designer and I as front-end. It was html and css only.Images are from internet and the face of John was created by the AI thisfacedoesntexist. Also helps me to practice git. Feel free to use this code. Thanks for reading and happy coding :}
