This small project was created so we both can practice our just learned skills. It was `html` and `css` only. Images are from internet and the face of John was created by AI **[ThisPersonDoesNotExist](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/)**. Also helps me to practice git. Feel free to use this code. Thanks for reading and happy coding :}
